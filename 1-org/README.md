# 1-org

The purpose of this step is to setup top level shared folders, monitoring & networking projects, org level logging and set baseline security settings through organizational policy.

## Prerequisites

1. 0-bootstrap executed successfully.

## Usage

### Setup to run via Cloud Build
1. Clone repo `gcloud source repos clone gcp-org --project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID (this is from `terraform output` from the previous section, 0-bootstrap)`
1. Navigate into the repo `cd gcp-org` and change to a non master branch `git checkout -b plan`
1. Copy contents of foundation to new repo `cp -R ../terraform-example-foundation/1-org/* .` (modify accordingly based on your current directory)
1. Rename terraform.example.tfvars to terraform.tfvars and update the file with values from your environment and bootstrap (you can re-run `terraform output` in the 0-bootstrap directory to find these values).
1. Rename backend.tf.example backend.tf and update with your bucket from bootstrap.
1. Commit changes with `git add .` and `git commit -m 'Your message'`
1. Push your non master branch to trigger a plan `git push --set-upstream origin plan`
    1. Review the plan output in your cloud build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID
1. Merge changes to master with `git checkout -b master` and `git push origin master`
    1. Review the apply output in your cloud build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID
